# MutualismDecline
Scripts for the simulations and figures associated to the article "Eco-evolutionary dynamics further weakens mutualistic interaction and coexistence under population decline" and its supplementary materials. this article is on biorXiv under the DOI [https://doi.org/10.1101/570580](https://doi.org/10.1101/570580)

It contains

1- In ''SciLab'' functions and simulation scripts to calculate the ecoloigcal density and singular strategies types and values at the eco-evolutionary equilibrium of our model for given parameter sets.

2- In ''R'' scripts to plot different figures with the simulations outputs, notably figures 4 and 5 of the article and D2 of the electronic supplementary materials. It also contains the R script for the functions and associated plot representing different trade-off shapes for figure 2.

3- In ''Mathematica'' the analytical calculations using adpative dynamics on our model and illustration of our results via PIPs, used to produce figure 3 of the main article.
