# MutualismDecline
Script for the simulations and figures associated to the article "Eco-evolutionary dynamics further weakens mutualistic interaction and coexistence under population decline" and its supplementary materials.

It Constains

1- In ''SciLab'' functions and simulation scripts to calculate the ecoloigcal density and singular strategies types and values at ecoevolutionary equilibrium of our model for given parameter sets.
2- In ''R'' scripts to plot different figures with the simulations outputs, notably figures 4 and 5 of the article and D2 of the electronic supplementary materials.
3- In ''Mathematica'' the analytical calculations using adpative dynamics on our models and illustration of our results via PIPs, used to produce figure 3 of the main article.
